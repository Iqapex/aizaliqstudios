          <h2>ðŸ§  A Sample Scenario Flow</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine a nursing student logging into our app and launching a simulation. They choose a patient case â€” for example, a patient showing symptoms of sepsis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game presents a real-time situation. The student must take vital signs, administer medication, make choices under pressure, and reflect on outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the experience, points, rewards, and AI-generated feedback help tailor learning. The flow simulates a real hospital experience, making learning truly immersive.
